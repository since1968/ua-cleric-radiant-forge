### Radiant Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of weaponmakers who work with metal, such as the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. Clerics of these deities march into battle against the forces of darkness, and often begin their careers as blacksmiths, barbarians, or soldiers.

#### Spear Mastery
You gain the following benefits when you wield a spear:
* You gain a + 1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.
* When you use a spear its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands.
* You can set your spear to receive a charge. As an action or a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that creature moves within your spear's reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can't use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.
* As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.

```

#### Weapon of the Forge
At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a simple or martial melee weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. This weapon is known as your sacred weapon. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You may use your sacred weapon in place of your holy symbol. 

At 6th level the sacred weapon's bonus increases to +2, and at 14th level this bonus increases to +3. 

While you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Constitution modifier as long as you are holding your sacred weapon. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. 


#### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Forge
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the energy of the forge, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your sacred weapon, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

You may also trigger this Channel Divinity effect as a reaction when a creature hits or misses you with a melee attack.  

#### Divine Strike
At 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your sacred weapon, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 3d6.

#### Soul of the Forge
Starting at 8th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While holding your sacred weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Avatar of Forge and Fury
At 17th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to become the embodiment of radiant majesty. As a bonus action, you present your sacred weapon and emanate an aura of radiant light. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius. 
* Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. 
* Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
* If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to succeed instead.
